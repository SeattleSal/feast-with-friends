## Description
Feast with Friends is a mobile and web application that recommends a list of restaurants that matches the users' dietary restrictions & specified location. Upon securely logging into our application and completing your profile, restaurant suggestions appear along with helpful details such as the restaurant's phone number, website URL, and image. 

This application was created with the following User Story and Acceptance Criteria in mind:
```
AS A person with dietary restrictions
I WANT to receive restaurant recommendations, which take into account my dietary restrictions and my chosen city 
SO THAT I can feast with friends without worrying about having anaphylaxis
```
```
GIVEN that I want a customized restaurant recommendation
WHEN I create an account
THEN my account is saved in the database and I securely log into the profile page 
WHEN I am brought to my profile page
THEN I see my saved preferences and recommended restaurants based on my preferences
WHEN I see the list of recommended restaurants 
THEN I see the restaurants’ name, image, phone number, and website link 
WHEN I update my preferences 
THEN I see updated recommendations that reflect my latest preferences 
```
